# Presentation FCT NOVA

This project is a non-official LaTeX and Microsoft PowerPoint presentation template themed for FCT NOVA.
It boasts the colours of the school and offers a myriad of pre-built slides that should suit your every need.

## Description

This template subserves the students of FCT NOVA that have to present projects publicly and don't want to spend time fiddling with any weird template to produce some beautiful slides. 

It was created with the intent of helping in the first steps of creating a presentation so that the student does not have to worry about the design aspects only has to focus on the content.
The Presentation FCT NOVA template is available in two flavours, one in LaTeX and the other in Microsoft PowerPoint.

You have 7 styles of slides at your disposal, but you can always start with a blank and personalise with the layout that you find most appropriate.
